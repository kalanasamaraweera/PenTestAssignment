## SYNOPSIS
Following  document explains expliotation procedure of discovered vulnerabilities in Python Django framework. Django is  aPython based web application development framework, initialy released on 2005.

### Reference

Source Code: https://github.com/django/django

Documentation: https://www.djangoproject.com/

## Setup Environment

First we'll install Python 3.7 distribution on our host OS Ubuntu. In this case, I've used `Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS` for the analysis.

1. Install Python 3.7
 
 Open terminal and execute below command to install Python.
 
 `sudo apt-get install python3`  

  (Note: By default Ubuntu has Python 2.7 distribution installed. However we use Python 3.7 for our analysis. Therefore recommend to uninstall 2.7 version)

 Assuming, Python 2.7 has uninstalled; We can set below alias to invoke Python 3. Otherwise  you can use `python3` command for rest of the tutorial.
 
 `alias python=python3`

 2. Install Python Package Manager

 Next, we can try installing Python package manager `pip3`. Therefore run below command:

 `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip`

 Then again, we can set alias for pip3 same as above.

 `alias pip3=pip`

 3. Create Virtual Environment

We use `pip3` to download Python virtual environment package. Virtual environment isolates dependent packages from Python global environment. Therefore it avoids any potential conflicts of dependencies with global environment provided by standard Python installation. For example, we can have our vulnerable Django package installed on a pre-configured environment, while having the patched version in the global environment. This provides a primitive sand-box for our PenTest analysis and hardening to host's global environment.

Run below command to install environment package

`pip install virtualenv`

4. Create Virtual Environment

Create directory to setup our solution.

`mkdir PenTestAssignment`

Navigate inside created directory

`cd PenTestAssignment`

Now, we can create a our Python environment for the analysis. So, execute below command

`virtualenv env`

Once environment has created use below command to  access it
 
 `. env\bin\activate `

 Note our domain user prefix changes to `<USER-NAME>@<MACHINE-NAME>(env)` on console. Now we can head for installing Django and create a  sample project.


## Create Project

Use below command to install Django framework on our local environment. This will 
take a moment.

`pip install django==2.2`

Here, we can mention the specific version of package that we want to install. Next, we can go ahead creating our new project. 

`django-admin startproject HackMeIfUCan`

Once our project created, we need to set the `http` port where it will be accessible. Also we need to mention the  IP-Address of host's network interface, where our application getting exposed to the domain.

We can use below firewall rule to open port 8000 where Django hosts by default.

`sudo ufw allow 8000`

Then we need to mention the IP-Address, where the application can be publically accessible. Open terminal and type `ifconfig`. In my case it has `enp3s0` as the IP-Version-4 network interface. 

Copy the displayed IP-Version-4 Ip-Address; then move inside the created Django project (i.e. HackMeIfUCan). Access the sub-folder `HackMeIfUCAn`.  Open-up the `settings.py` file. You can use nano editor for this.

`nano settings.py`

Include the copied IP-Address to `ALLOWED_HOSTS=[]` array. Now we are ready to startup our project. In Django, enrty point for project startup is `manage.py`, located inside root folder of Django project.

    --HackMeIfUCan 
        --HackMeIfUCan
            | -- settings.py
            | -- asgi.py
            | -- wsgi.py
            | -- urls.py
            | -- __init__.py
        -- manage.py


Run below command to start hosting the application.

`python manage.py runserver <ABOVE-IP-ADDRESS>:8000`
