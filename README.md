# PenTestAssignment
SLIIT Penetration Testing Assignment 2020 (3rd Semester)

S.A.K.G. Samaraweera  (MS19804552)


## SYNOPSIS
Following  document explains expliotation procedure of discovered vulnerabilities in Python Django framework.


## Setup Environment

First we'll install Python 3.7 distribution on our host OS Ubuntu. In this case, I've used `Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS` for the analysis.

1. Install Python 3.7
 
 Open terminal and execute below command to install Python.
 
 `sudo apt-get install python3`  

  (Note: By default Ubuntu has Python 2.7 distribution installed. However we use Python 3.7 for our analysis. Therefore recommend to uninstall 2.7 version)

 Assuming, Python 2.7 has uninstalled; We can set below alias to invoke Python 3. Otherwise  you can use `python3` command for rest of the tutorial.
 
 `alias python=python3`

 2. Install Python Package Manager

 Next, we can try installing Python package manager `pip3`. Therefore run below command:

 `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip`

 Then again, we can set alias for pip3 same as above.

 `alias pip3=pip`

 3. Create Virtual Environment

We use `pip3` to download Python virtual environment package. Virtual environment isolates dependent packages from Python global environment. Therefore it avoids any potential conflicts of dependencies with global environment provided by standard Python installation. For example, we can install our vulnerable Django package in to a pre-configured environment while having the patched package in the global environment. This provides a primitive sand-box for our PenTest analysis  and hardening to host's global environment.

Run below command to install environment package

`pip install virtualenv`

4. Create Virtual Environment

Create directory to create our solution.

`mkdir PenTestAssignment`

Navigate inside created directory

`cd PenTestAssignment`

Now, we can create a our Python environment for the analysis. So, execute below command

`virtualenv env`

Once environment has created use below command to  access it
 
 `. env\bin\activate `

 Note our domain user prefix changes to `<USER-NAME>@<MACHINE-NAME>(env)` on console. Now we can head for installing Django and create a  sample project.
